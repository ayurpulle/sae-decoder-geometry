## 2026-10-30 — Phase 0: reproduce galaxy-scale eigen slopes

**What the original computes** (ejmichaud/feature-geometry `galaxy/PointCloudStructure_Galaxy.ipynb`, cells 10, 15, 18):
- SAEs: `gemma-scope-2b-pt-res`, **width 65k** (not 16k), one L0 per layer (L0: 73, L12: 72, L24: 124; full table in cell 10).
- Cloud: raw `sae.W_dec` (65536 × 2304). No explicit row normalisation. Gemma Scope rows are already unit norm (we measured 1 ± 3e-7).
- Covariance: `np.cov(W_dec, rowvar=False)`, i.e. **centred**, ddof=1. Eigenvalues from `eigvalsh`, sorted descending.
- Fit: `linregress(log10 rank, log10 eig)` over 0-based slice `[10:150]`, i.e. **ranks 11–150** (only ~1.1 decades). The reported value is the slope; the "α" in their figure is −slope.
- Their null: N(0,1) of shape 65536×2304, scaled ×0.005 for the plot. Slope −0.0276 (Marchenko–Pastur spread at n/d≈28).
- No dead-latent filtering and no frequency weighting.

**Our implementation:** `geometry.eigen_slope` (defaults match the above), driven by `experiments/phase0_reproduce.py`.
Raw `params.npz` W_dec matches sae_lens `SAE.W_dec` for residual SAEs (the loader rescales only embedding SAEs).

**Results** (`results/phase0/phase0.json`, `spectra.png`):

| layer | paper | ours | rel diff | R² | uncentred | unit-norm | matched Gaussian |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0  | −0.2383 | −0.2383 | +0.02% | 0.999 | −0.2383 | −0.2383 | −0.0276 |
| 12 | −0.4684 | −0.4684 | −0.01% | 0.994 | −0.4692 | −0.4684 | −0.0276 |
| 24 | −0.2545 | −0.2545 | +0.01% | 0.999 | −0.2547 | −0.2545 | −0.0276 |

**GO**: reproduced to <0.1%.

**Surprises / flags for later phases**
- Centring is irrelevant here: the mean decoder direction is tiny, so top eigenvalues barely change.
- Fit-range sensitivity is large. The spectrum is curved, not a clean power law:

  | range (0-based) | L0 | L12 | L24 |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | [1,15)    | −0.25 | −0.37 | −0.18 |
  | [3,50)    | −0.22 | −0.48 | −0.25 |
  | [10,150)  | −0.24 | −0.47 | −0.25 |
  | [30,450)  | −0.26 | −0.42 | −0.24 |
  | [100,1500)| −0.37 | −0.57 | −0.34 |

  The ordering L12 steeper than L0 ≈ L24 holds in every window. Absolute values move by up to ~0.13 across a 1-decade shift, though, so any theory-vs-data comparison of the *value* (e.g. against (1+α)/(1+b)) has to fix the rank window and report this spread.
- The spectrum falls off sharply above rank ~1000 (bulk edge / rank limit at d = 2304). Fit windows must stay below that.
- The isotropic Gaussian null is very weak: at n/d = 28 it is nearly flat by construction. It says nothing about what an SAE trained on structureless data would produce (Phase 2).

**Available variants for Phase 1** (`results/available_saes.json`, from the sae_lens registry and cross-checked 1:1 against the HF repo tree, 316 SAEs):
- All 26 layers: 16k × 5–6 L0s and 65k × 5–6 L0s.
- Layer 12 only: 16k, 32k, 65k, 131k, 262k, 524k, 1m (6 L0s each). This is the only full width sweep.
- 1m also at layers 5 and 19.
- Each 65k npz is 1.2 GB. The 1m files are ~18 GB each, so pulling only W_dec matters for disk and time.

**Next decision:** Phase 1 scope. Recommend starting with the layer-12 width ladder (7 widths × 6 L0s), then 16k/65k across layers.
